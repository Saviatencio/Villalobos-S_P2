    <h1>Business</h1>
    <p>Salesforce is a global leader in customer relationship management (“CRM”) technology that enables companies to improve their relationships and interactions with customers. Founded in 1999, Salesforce empowers companies of every size and industry to connect with their customers in new ways through existing 3 and emerging technologies, including cloud, mobile, social, Internet of Things (“IoT”) and artificial intelligence (“AI”), to grow their business and work more productively. The Salesforce Customer Success Platform delivers services spanning sales, service, marketing, commerce, engagement, integration, analytics, industries, communities, enablement and collaboration, most of which operate on a single trusted cloud platform. Our service offerings are designed to be intuitive and easy to use. They can be deployed quickly via mobile devices and major internet browsers, configured easily, and integrated with other platforms and enterprise applications. We sell to businesses worldwide primarily on a subscription basis, through our direct sales efforts and also indirectly through partners. Through our platform and other developer tools, we also enable third parties to develop additional functionality and new applications, or apps, that run on our platform, which are sold separately from—or in conjunction with—our service offerings.</p>

<p>Most of our service offerings operate on a single customer success platform and are deployed in an identical way even though we have offerings in multiple enterprise cloud computing markets, including as a result of our acquisitions. Our core offerings are suited to meet the needs of our customers in certain industries, such as solutions for financial services, healthcare and government. Additionally, our core offerings enable companies to quickly create and manage trusted, branded digital destinations for customers, partners and employees, collectively referred to as community management.
